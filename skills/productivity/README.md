# Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

## User-invoked

Configured for explicit user invocation in Claude Code (`disable-model-invocation: true`) and Codex (`policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`). Hermes does not enforce those flags as explicit-only; see [host-specific invocation](./writing-for-agents/SKILL-MECHANICS.md#host-behavior).

- **[grill-me](./grill-me/SKILL.md)**: Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[session-handoff](./session-handoff/SKILL.md)**: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document so another agent can continue the work.
- **[teach](./teach/SKILL.md)**: Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[to-questionnaire](./to-questionnaire/SKILL.md)**: Turn a decision you can't answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can (filled in async, or together over a meeting).
- **[wait-what](./wait-what/SKILL.md)**: Fire this the moment a message doesn't land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you're missing, in plain English, using your `GLOSSARY.md` vocabulary.

## Model-invoked

Model- or user-reachable (rich trigger phrasing so the model can reach for them).

- **[grilling](./grilling/SKILL.md)**: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[writing-for-agents](./writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)**: Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.
